<p>How I think of Ideas</p><p>Thinking of ideas is easy. You can look at anything and see a way to improve it, a new way to make it. The hard part is thinking of something new. 
</p><p><b>Find your Problem</b></p><p>Ideas solve problems. Whatever they are, you hate tying your shoes, or despise driving and owning a car. We have ideas to overcome problems. 
</p><p>Finding the right problem to solve is the hardest part. This is where the majority of people fail (at least that I have seen). They will often solve a problem that  doesn’t exist, does not need a solution, or has already been solved better than they are capable of solving it.
</p><p>The best way to find a problem worth solving is to just look around you, but be careful. Many of the obvious problems  have already been solved, very, very well or do not need the obvious solution. For instance event invitation oror which bars are full. The which bars are full apps which every other person you talk to will be working on is the obvious problem they are solving, but the actual problem is realtime population tracking.
</p><p>If you look around you and can’t find any good unsolved problems it could mean you’ve been in the same place for too long. Changing you view going on a trip, getting a new job, watching different movies, these new experiences will force you to ask why things are the way they are. Shifting your view is the easiest way to find problems to solve.
</p><p>The lazy way to find problems is to watch TED talks, read the news, and read books, you will have less experience with the problem you are trying to solve and may not be able to get familiar enough with the downsides of the problem being unsolved, but it serves as a good way to find problems worth solving.
</p><p>Being sensitive to your “laziness” is also important to finding problems. If you start a new job and they tell you to put old papers on the computer by typing out the the papers into the computer you might think that is gonna take a long time, and that you really don’t want to do that. That problem can be solved by taking a picture of each page and putting it through some software to digitize the pages without you needing to type out a letter. 
</p><p>We often do mindless work that we do not want to do but “have” to do. This is a problem and sometimes there is a relatively simple solution. Don’t like putting plates away? Just buy a second dishwasher. Use the clean plates from the first dishwasher, use them and put the dirty ones and empty dishwasher till it is full. Then repeat. 
</p><p>These are the problems we face everyday but that many people have grown numb to after the years of doing them. That is why the best time to find new problems to solve is when you first get your new job, school, first start driving or just generally start doing something new. Get out of your comfort zone and ask why things are done the way they are. A lot of times you will hear “it’s always been done this way” and that’s when you know there may be a “good” idea buried somewhere in there.
</p><p><b>Define your Parameters</b></p><p>Once you have your problem it’s time to define the ideal implementation of that problem.
</p><p>What makes a good idea is entirely dependent on the context. If you are thinking of new ways to store renewably generated energy a good idea could be sustainably made, low maintenance costs, and relatively cheap to make. If you are trying to come up with an energy storage solution to pitch to investors think about what boxes an investor needs checked: large market potential, good return on investment, executable by the pitching team. 
</p><p>Every problem you are trying to solve will have parameters the solution is going to need to satisfy. Whether you are coming up with a personal project you want to do, a quick money making scheme, or a full blown business. There are parameters you need to define so you can put the jigsaw pieces of knowledge you have together in a way that fits your parameters to come up with a potential solution.
</p><p><b>Putting the Pieces Together</b></p><p>Once you have defined the parameters needed to solve the problem you need to satisfy it’s time to try and find your idea.
</p><p>All an idea really is just a bunch of random knowledge linked together in a new way. Which sounds simple enough until you realize you need to have that knowledge. You need to somehow know enough about the world 
</p><p>At the bottom there are bunch of links to sites where you can get exposed to great ideas and find what is currently possible, but knowing what has been done shows you the boundaries of what is possible. You can take the ideas you see and put them together in different ways and see what problems you can solve. 
</p><p>That’s really all there is to creating an idea. The hard part is finding the problem and setting the right parameter then it is just a matter of linking knowledge to find the solution. 
</p><p><b>Vetting the Idea</b></p><p>Vetting the idea is partially redundant to setting the parameters, but it is a necessary step to making sure you do not waste time on an idea that is not actually as good as it sounds.
</p><p>First of all is it possible for you to implement your idea. What resources people, contractors, machines, knowledge will you need to execute it?
</p><p>Is it is costs sensitive or will it cost more to implement than you think it is worth?
</p><p>Just keeping pounding the idea against the walls and the payment until you discover all its flaws. Do people need it? Does it adequately solve the problem? Has it been done before? Has it been done very well before? Is there somewhere else the idea beyond the first implementation? Can it grow? 
</p><p>Just keep asking questions of the idea and metaphorically beating the living shit out of it until you are confident is can remain standing. 
</p><p>The idea is a bit shellshocked and shy so make sure to wait a bit before beating it up to ruminate convince yourself it is good. After that point you might have a decent idea. Now go ask your parents or a friend you trust. Make sure they are open minded. Many people HATE ideas. I can’t explain it or understand it, but many people will try and beat up your idea and how bad it is instead of asking the questions and looking for holes you maybe didn’t think of (that is the right way to vet an idea). If you have friend who always tries to eviscerate ideas walk away they are not worth keeping around. 
</p><p>Ideas remain fragile after they are born you need to vet it. And when it is a bit stronger talk to people you really trust. Often they will find the holes you can’t fix or show you a good iteration that has already been done, in which case you ask if this is worth pursuing and try to ask yourself why it isn’t even if you are on the high a new idea gives you, try and back off and look at if from afar. 
</p><p>Of all the things here the vetting is problaly the most important part. Sure finding a problem and defining and problem are vital, but during the vetting you determine whether this is an idea you wish to pursue possibly for years. Something that adheres to your core values and you would let represent you and your ideals.
</p><p><b>BONUS:</b></p><p>Following these steps takes practice. Lots of practice. For two years everyday I would come up with an idea. It didn’t have to be good or adhere to this list. It just had to be an idea and I had to explain. 
</p><p>I wrote the ideas down in evernote and still have them here. They are not great. But they were my start. The pile of bad ideas helped me practice vetting and figuring out what constitutes that “good” idea we all seek.
</p><p>Here are the titles of the first 5 ideas I put in the evernote: Robotic Arm pot cleaner, Reminder watch band, Dry Eye Goggles, On Bike, Bike Lock, Urinal Advertising. So Yeah. That was three years ago when I started. It just takes practice and gathering up more knowledge you can call upon to more easily solve the everyday problems you face and hear about.
