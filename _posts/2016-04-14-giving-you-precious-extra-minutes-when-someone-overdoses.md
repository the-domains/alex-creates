Giving you precious extra minutes when someone overdoses.

When someone overdoses but they are still standing, maybe it's because it hasn't hit them yet there is little you can do depending on the drug.

When a kid finds some low lying pills and starts eating them as 2 -4 year old do there is a huge problem. Especially in the usual case when the parent walks in an sees their child with kills and chemicals smeared around their mouth and all over. How much did they take? What was it? Will he die? Oh shit. We gotta get to the hospital, NOW.

The absorption of those ingested meds is the difference between life and death. If the child recently ate the absorption will be slower and there will be more time to get him to the hospital. If the stomach is empty that kid's digestion system will be absorbing the material fast. And will be getting sicker and sicker till something probably really bad happens. So time is everything.

If you you as a parent could slow the rate of absorption down it could buy your child precious time to get to the hospital. Liquid cocktail of activated charcoal you keep in your medicine cabinet could do just that. It would slow down the absorption of the drug the child ingested and could save your child's life.

The idea is essentially a small bottle of activated carbon that you force drink your child in order to stop go tract absorption and reduce the likelihood of your kids absorbing the drug and then taking the bottle and going to the hospital as fast a humanly possible.
