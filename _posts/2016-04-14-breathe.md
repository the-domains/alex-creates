Breathe

A light jacket that seamlessly integrate air pollution filters when you can easily don when going outside in polluted air.

The jackets will have many smart features beyond the air purification. But in order to accommodate its primary feature it must have a few key design elements. The first is a cross body zipper that end to the left of the neck, 4 inches left of the centerline. The second feature is a large collar to allow the wearer to more easily duck into the pure air filter in the collar. The collar front needs to come up higher that a typical collar to more simply cover the face. But to do this it either needs to be a bigger collar than normal, which could be off putting, or it needs.

No specific fabric requirements just high quality materials that can withstand the tests of time.

Simply having the air pollution filtration system in the collar is not enough to sell a sweater. Most people do not take the precautions they should to protect themselves from the life-shortening and would not purposefully buy a jacket that could help them.

After that we have the typical high end jacket features:

1. 2 front waist pockets
2. side-access chest pocket
3. Tension strap around the waist
4. Interior micro-fiber lined pocket
5. And the filtration system

There would be a woman and men's version.
